Borrowing another idea from <a target="_blank" href="https://simonwillison.com">Simon Willison's blog</a>, I’ve added a <a href="{{ '/tools' | relative_url }}">tools page</a> where I’ll be posting experimental HTML applications, mostly the result of vibe coding with LLMs. I like this as a way of capturing what these models are capable of at a given point in time, and I’m interested to see how the complexity of the apps evolves as I get more comfortable with this style of ‘coding’. I’m not trying to take humans out of the loop (and would never advocate that), but asking an LLM to generate a complete working app from just one or a handful of prompts, even if the result is small, feels like a useful benchmark. It also gives generative AI that ‘sci-fi’ feel that makes it so fascinating to use.
