> Your ChatGPT agent content (including screenshots) may be accessed by a limited number of authorized OpenAI personnel, as well as trusted service providers that are subject to confidentiality and security obligations in order to: (1) investigate abuse or a security incident; (2) provide support to you if you reach out to us with questions about your account; (3) handle legal matters; or (4) improve model performance (unless you have opted out). Access to content is subject to technical access controls and limited only to authorized personnel on a need-to-know basis. Additionally, we monitor and log all access to user content and authorized personnel must undergo security and privacy training prior to accessing any user content.

Vitally important to be aware of this from a GDPR perspective.
