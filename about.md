<p>I've always been a dedicated note-taker when it comes to coding, especially when learning a new technology, but until now I've kept them all privately tucked away on GitHub.</p>

<p>When I made the decision to go 'all in' on AI and get a fuller understanding of the current advancements, my research quickly led me to <a target="_blank" href="https://simonwillison.com">Simon Willison's blog</a>. He's a British programmer who famously co-founded the Django framework, and is a prolific blogger about his AI research, where he frequently shares his interesting findings and it's a fascinating read. I really enjoy his approach to sharing what he discovers, especially given how rapidly AI is advancing, so Iâ€™m taking a leaf out of his book. (or his blog, if you will).</p>

<p>After recently spending 3 months on a solo motorbike trip around Europe and blogging about it for friends and family, it's made me more used to publishing my thoughts. I doubt they'll be reading this though - it's not quite the same as blogging about driving past bears in Romania.</p>
